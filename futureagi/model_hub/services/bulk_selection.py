"""Filter-based bulk selection resolvers for annotation queue add-items.

These functions mirror the filter application pipeline of the corresponding
list views (e.g. ``tracer.views.trace.list_traces_of_session`` for traces)
and return the matching row IDs capped at ``cap``, with the deselected-rows
set subtracted. They are the server-side equivalent of "Select all N matching
this filter" in the UI.

Do not add presentation/column logic here — this module returns IDs only.

Scope in this module:

- ``resolve_filtered_trace_ids`` — Phase 1. Mirrors
  ``list_traces_of_session`` filter semantics for ``source_type="trace"``.

Resolvers cover ``trace`` (+voice), ``observation_span``, ``trace_session``,
and ``call_execution``.

ClickHouse migration status:

  Each resolver mirrors its grid's list view by instantiating the SAME v2
  ``query_builders`` list builder (``TraceListQueryBuilder`` /
  ``VoiceCallListQueryBuilder`` / ``SpanListQueryBuilder`` /
  ``SessionListQueryBuilder``) through the ``ClickHouseFilterBuilder`` translator,
  so filter semantics match the grid exactly.

  - trace, voice, span, session: ClickHouse ONLY. No PG tracer-table read — rows
    come only from CH. When the payload sends no time bound, an all-history
    window is injected (``_all_history_time_filter``) so "select all matching"
    spans everything instead of the builders' now-30d default. Drop-safe: a CH
    failure propagates rather than falling back, and an empty CH result is
    authoritative. Session score-label filters intersect the annotation ``Score``
    table, which is NOT a tracer table.

  Project / annotation-label / ``Score`` PG lookups stay — those tables are not
  being dropped. ``call_execution`` resolves from the ``simulate`` PG tables,
  which are also not tracer tables.
